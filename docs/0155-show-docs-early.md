# Show docs directory and related errors early

A **feature request**, created on **July 6, 2025**

## Status

In draft

## Description

It would be prudent to ensure we tell the user where we will put the docs as early in the script as possible. We will also want to test the ability to write to the directory ASAP --- before user input, if possible.
